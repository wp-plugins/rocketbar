The quicker page switcher!? Keyboard shortcuts for your WordPress Dashboard.

== Description ==

The RocketBar is a new, faster (FREE) way to get around in WordPres. Instead of clicking from page to page, just hit a keyboard shortcut and immediately go where you're headed!

The plugin is designed after the OSX Spotlight Search feature, and uses a keybinding of `SHIFT + SPACE` to open.

**But wait, there's more!**

RocketBar also supports several commands and shortcuts that do various actions based on where on your site you're at. For example,
on a WordPress Post or Page? Open RocketBar and type in <code>edit</code>. Hit ENTER and you're now editing the Post or Page you were on.

Check out all of RocketBar's commands! Install now!
